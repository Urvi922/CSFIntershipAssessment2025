# Software Development Assessment for Canadian Sheep Federation Internship 

I am Urvi Patel. I have created a web application which uses The Meal DB public API, from the given list of public API's. The web application lets the user search meals from the public API, the user has an option to get the details of the meal like recpices and ingredients. The user can rate the meal and give their feedback on it. They can also checkout reviews for meals from other users and any suggestions on the how to improve the meal.

# How to run the web application:

1. Pull the code from repository to the local machine. 
2. Open the folder in code editor.
3. Go to the terminal of the code editor, nagivate to frontend and run 'npm start'.
3. Kepp this terminal running and open new terminal in the code editor.
4. In your new terminal, navigate to backend and run 'npm start'.
5. The web application will run in you open browser. 
6. Search the meal you want, add a review and checkout reviews of other visitors.

# API extension and improvement idea

The upgraded API allows to enter own meals and images which can be used to add new meals to public API DB. Can also add nutritional and health benefit information for each meals to help users to choose meal to try accordings to their health requirments. 

# Application and API Deplyoment

The web application can be deployed on vercel as the database is not too complex. 

# Design and User Interface

The current web application has basic minimal desgin and responsive user interface. We can improve the UI further when the web application grows depending on the requirments.
